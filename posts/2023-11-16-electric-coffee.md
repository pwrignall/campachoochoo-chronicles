After visiting the tooth doctor, sampling the coffee somewhere recommended to me by a friend.

## Today's ride

Following a dentist's appointment in the morning, I was in a different part of town to usual so took it as an opportunity to try my latest Coffeeneur venture on different roads to a completely new destination for me.

I caught a break in the steady rain showers and made my way to Ealing Broadway and **[Electric Coffee Co](https://www.electriccoffee.co.uk/)**, where I grabbed a bag of beans from Malawi alongside a tasty cortado.

The place was busy, friendly, and I'd recommend it if you're ever in W5.

Sneaking in a Coffeeneur during my commute to the office in central London.

_(Writing this up ten days after it took place, I just didn't get around to it.)_

It was a miserable, rain-filled morning, and I got soaked on the ten-minute ride from home to my local railway station. I planned to take a fast train to Victoria and try **Omotesando Koffee** on my way to the office in EC2. This plan disintegrated with railway signalling problems.

Instead I took the next London-bound train and it proceeded to chug slowly along the track, seemingly overtaken at every opportunity by the trains scheduled behind it. An hour and twenty minutes later than I originally thought I'd be in London, I alighted at Blackfriars.

Still, what better way to forget that journey than by finding a nice place for a hot drink and some breakfast? I'd used the time on the train to plot a route to **The Ethiopian Coffee Company**, not far from King's Cross.

Thankfully the rain had eased from earlier and, apart from getting beeped by an impatient Mercedes driver, the journey to Islington was an uneventful one.

One cappuccino plus one cheese and ham toastie later, I was good to go!

Continuing the Coffeeneuring Challenge from last week, the sun's still high but the temperature's not.

What a difference a week makes. Temperatures are a little more seasonal than [last week's outing](./2023-10-08-coffeeneuring-kick-off.md) but a significant 15&deg;C drop. Puffy jackets and jeans instead of t-shirts and shorts today!

## Today's ride

Since I was a little short on time today, I just popped to the local recreation ground's caf√©, making sure to meet the challenge's two-mile round trip minimum.

In which I enjoy a bacon and brie panini at a place with an excellent name.

## Today's ride

Today's Coffeeneur was #6 of the [2023 Coffeeneuring Challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2023/09/24/coffeeneuring-challenge-2023-lucky-13/) and one I tied in with some lunchtime errands.

**Coffee at Planet Sweet** was the name of my destination and served up a delightful bacon and brie panini alongside a very frothy coffee.

It felt great to get out into the fresh air for a bit before back to grappling with some data for the rest of the afternoon.

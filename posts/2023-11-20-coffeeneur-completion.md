Rounding off the [2023 Coffeeneuring Challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2023/09/24/coffeeneuring-challenge-2023-lucky-13/) with a fizzle.

I only just managed to squeeze in today's ride to complete the requisite seven rides, leaving it to the last minute as I often do.

## Today's ride

It almost went wrong, I headed out for a late lunch and meandered to make up the minimum two-mile distance rule before arriving at my planned coffee stop to realise it was closed on Mondays.

So, I continued in the direction of **Chalk Hills Bakery**, a kiosk attached to the bakery itself which meant enjoying a 'Coffee Shop Without Walls'. At least I remembered to bring a KeepCup and avoid a paper cup.

So, that's it, an end to a thoroughly enjoyable challenge which I expected to complete with a little more room to spare and saw me:

- Cycle 67.6 kilometres over seven rides
- Consume five cappuccinos (campachoochoos), one cortado and one flat white 
- Get my bike pretty filthy
- Have fun and feel good!

Until next year!

      "content_html": "<p>This guide will take you through the steps to plot a route map in QGIS, with lines between points as great circles.</p>\n<p>When I worked at an aviation news and data company called <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/\">FlightGlobal</a>, we occasionally\nwanted to display a map showing newly-announced routes, the geographical reach of a carrier, or the top n routes in a\nregion.</p>\n<p>For static maps, intended to be printed, I used the excellent geographic information system application,\n<a href=\"https://qgis.org/\">QGIS</a>. Whilst my process most certainly could be streamlined, I’m laying it out here so if you ever\nfeel like mapping some routes, you can too!</p>\n<h2 id=\"data-prep\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/route-maps-with-qgis/#data-prep\">Data prep</a></h2>\n<p>Route maps tend to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance\">great circles</a> to connect points on a map.\nBecause of things like weather these are not the exact coordinates an aircraft would follow, but they’re used because\nthey’re the shortest distance between two points. And they look nice.</p>\n<p>I had an R script I used to use for this. But I’ve lost it. My attempt to re-write it in Python took a while but,\nthanks to the <a href=\"https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/Python/doc/examples.html\">geographiclib</a> package and its\nexamples, I got something working that does a decent job.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/pwrignall/gclines\">script is on GitHub</a> with instructions and takes a couple of inputs to\nproduce two outputs: a file containing unique airports, <em>airport_points.csv</em>, and a file containing all\nthe points needed to create the great circle lines in QGIS, <em>route_points.csv</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adding-data-layers-to-qgis\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/route-maps-with-qgis/#adding-data-layers-to-qgis\">Adding data layers to QGIS</a></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve <a href=\"https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html\">installed QGIS</a>, you’ll need to add your data as layers\nin the application. Once all of your data layers are in, you can experiment with different styles and map projections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"map-base-layer\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/route-maps-with-qgis/#map-base-layer\">Map base layer</a></h3>\n<p>For this I recommend the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.naturalearthdata.com/\">Natural Earth</a> project. Medium scale should be\nfine for this use case, so you can navigate to the <em>1:50m Physical</em> downloads and save the <em>Land</em> layer — which\nincludes polygons for land and major islands of the world — to a working directory on your device.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In QGIS, in an empty project, add that layer through the menu options: <strong>Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector\nLayer…</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By <em>Vector Dataset(s)</em>, browse to your downloaded Natural Earth .zip file and then click <strong>Add</strong>.

For this example, I’ve\nplotted the hypothetical route travelled by the Champions League trophy since 1993, from the venue of that year’s final\nin Munich (MUC) through all the winners’ nearest airports and the other final venues.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer…</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By <em>File Name</em>, browse to your working directory and select the <strong>route_points.csv</strong> file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under <em>File Format</em>, verify <strong>CSV</strong> is selected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under <em>Geometry Definition</em>, select <strong>EPSG:4326 - WGS 84</strong> as the <em>Geometry CRS</em> and click <strong>Add</strong>. You can then\nclose this dialog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With the route_points layer selected, find the <strong>Zoom to Layer</strong> button on the toolbar or within the <em>View</em> menu to\nzoom in and focus on your routes, if you like.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<figure><a href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/02-route-points.png\"><img src=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/02-route-points.png\" alt=\"Blobs on shapes, zoomed in.

I may revisit this and see if <a href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Beeline/\">Beeline</a> (which led me to the Python\nfunctions I used in my own script) can offer a simpler alternative to what I’m doing.\nInstead, I’ve used a plugin called <a href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/points2one/\">Points2One</a> to transform the long list\nof longitude/latitude coordinate sequences to a set of lines.</p>\n<p>Install the plugin through the menu, <strong>Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins…</strong> and search for\n“Points2One”.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<p>Select the Points2One dialog through <strong>Vector → Points2One → Points2One</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Input vector layer</em> should be <strong>route_points</strong>.

You can choose an in-built style or make up your own.\nYou can modify object fills and strokes and that’s all I’ll be doing for this map, using <strong>Simple Fill</strong>, <strong>Simple\nLine</strong> and <strong>Simple Marker</strong> depending on the layer type.</p>\n<p>You can also adjust the canvas colour through <strong>Project → Properties → General → Background color</strong>.</p>\n<p>Toggle a layer’s visibility completely by clicking the eye-shaped icon next to a layer. We want to do this now for the\nroute_points layer.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/05-after-some-styling.png\"><img src=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/05-after-some-styling.png\" alt=\"Choosing colours is hard.\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" /></a><figcaption>Choosing colours is hard.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3 id=\"airport-labels\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/route-maps-with-qgis/#airport-labels\">Airport labels</a></h3>\n<p>We can add text labels to give the viewer an idea of which airport is where.</p>\n<p>Double-click the airport_points layer then select <strong>Labels</strong>. Choose <strong>Single Labels</strong> from the dropdown. For <em>Value</em>\nI’m using the Expression Builder next to the field dropdown and have entered <code>&quot;iata_code&quot;  || ' ' || &quot;loc_name&quot;</code> which\nwill concatenate the airport code and municipality (maybe not the most intuitive name in all cases, as you’ll see) from\nthe airports input file.</p>\n<p>Within this dialog you can adjust the label font, placement and any text effects like buffers and shadows.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/06-label-maker.png\"><img src=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/06-label-maker.png\" alt=\"Adding a buffer to improve legibility.\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" /></a><figcaption>Adding a buffer to improve legibility.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3 id=\"map-projection\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/route-maps-with-qgis/#map-projection\">Map projection</a></h3>\n<p>When the geographic extent of a map is limited to a specific region, it’s a good opportunity to use a different map\nprojection to minimise the distortions we make when flattening a sphere onto a rectangle.</p>\n<p>My go-to tool for choosing a good projection is <a href=\"https://projectionwizard.org/\">Projection Wizard</a>. With it, we can\nspecify the boundaries of the map and receive some suggested projections in return. For this region, I’ll optimise by\nequal area and use an Albers equal-area conic projection. The tool also gives the coordinate string you need\nfor QGIS in either proj4 or WKT formats. QGIS accepts both but prefers WKT.</p>\n<p>Within QGIS, define a new projection from <strong>Settings → Custom Projections…</strong> Click the plus icon to add a\nnew projection, give it a name and paste the text from Projection Wizard into the <em>Parameters</em> box. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now re-project your map to the newly-defined projection by selecting <strong>Project → Properties…</strong>. In the\ndialog click <strong>CRS</strong> (Coordinate Reference System). Within <em>Predefined Coordinate Reference Systems</em> scroll down until\nyou see some under <strong>User-defined</strong> and select the name you just created. Click <strong>OK</strong> and there’s your re-projected\nmap!</p>\n<p>From here you can export the map as an image or PDF to further tweak it. Here’s my end product, after exporting and\nadding a title. I also took the opportunity to edit airport_points.csv and tidy up the location name labels.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/07-reprojected.png\"><img src=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/assets/images/qgis-routes/07-reprojected.png\" alt=\"Lots of visits to Milan, Munich and Madrid.\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" /></a><figcaption>Lots of visits to Milan, Munich and Madrid.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"summary\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://chronicles.campachoochoo.net/route-maps-with-qgis/#summary\">Summary</a></h2>\n<p>And that’s it, although quite an involved process end-to-end this doesn’t take too long once you’re used to it. Except\nmaybe choosing the colours. With this method you can create quite detailed explanatory maps as well as more abstract\nones like this.

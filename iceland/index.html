    <h1>What we did in Iceland</h1>
    <aside>And maybe you should think about doing when you're there too</aside>

    <p>We stayed in Reykjavik so most of these are in and around the city.</p>

    <h2>Attractions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Reykjavik</h3>
            <p>The town is really compact and you can see most of it on foot.</p>
            <p>There's a nice lake/pond in the middle of the city you can wander around and the shops are located predominantly
                on two main streets.</p>
            <p>We didn't make it there, but you might be interested in checking out
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KJ2wXAN6muS2">The Icelandic Phallalogical Museum</a>.</p>
        </li>

                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6BCWJ3czr432">Hallgrimskirkja</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Striking concrete cathedral in the city. Small fee to climb up to the roof for good views.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/msu1Gw6P7112">Perlan</a>
            </h3>
            <p>We walked but it's a decent trek. Revolving fine dining if you fancy it but we went during the day and had a
                sweet snack in the cafeteria.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mdT4RBzmjk72">Harpa Concert Hall and Conference Centre</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Pretty seaside building, you can wander around or catch a performance. Not far from
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_Voyager">The Sun Voyager</a> sculpture.</p>
        </li>

                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hm2EjBNE5ix">Icelandic Horse Park - Fákasel</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Part of a package bus tour to see the Golden Circle: see some horses, drink some coffee, buy some expensive souvenirs.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/d3NdQUNy8S22">Geysir</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Part of a package bus tour to see the Golden Circle: watch the ever reliable Strokkur spurt every 8 minutes.
                We had lunch in the adjoining visitor centre which was actually pretty decent despite catering for all those
                tourists.

                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WkwJnLw7eeP2">Thingvellir</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Yeh that Þ is pronounced as "th"! Part of a package bus tour to see the Golden Circle: cool national park where
                parliament started, have a wander and feel like you're in Game of Thrones.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Part of a package bus tour to see the Golden Circle: where we went for a thermal spa dip, avoiding the hordes

    <h2>Food</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>

                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/H9yevAQez7y">Restó</a>

                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hShpZBRPvaq">Sægreifinn</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Here you can have the famous fermented shark if you so desire. We settled for fish kebabs and they were scrummy.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Tu9HFR8PXCS2">Icelandic Fish and Chips</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Very popular, decent but nothing amazing.</p>

        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Sd6eHDXvKR82">Messinn</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Where we had our last supper in Reykjavik, a very nice way to end the trip. Good seafood.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Places we missed</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JpSy2yLkinE2">Sandholt</a> was a highly rated bakery/cafe that we didn't stop by at.</p>
            <p>We also saw good things about
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mcwrZRPxVCs">Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur</a> if you fancy a hot dog.</p>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Drinks</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7BHifGPPZS52">Reykjavik Roasters</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The hipster's choice. Beard optional.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Kaffitar</h3>
            <p>Multiple locations, Iceland's (nicer) version of Costa.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/K75RcMjXAYk">Hurra</a>
            </h3>
            <p>We came here for a pre-dinner drink. Or it could have been the place next door, Gaukurinn, because they look
                pretty similar. I think there was live music. Standing room only and loud, pretty nice vibe.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w2Au1rQeEEo">Bar at Hotel Reykjavik Centrum</a>
            </h3>
            <p>This is the hotel we stayed at. The bar inside was cosy, did snacks as well as cocktails using Brennivín.</p>
